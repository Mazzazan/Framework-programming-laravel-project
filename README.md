## Webpage Project

## Home page

Here is the home page after following the tutorial. I used a pre-built template from tailwind called "Stacked layouts" under the Application UI tab. I changed the logo beside the Home tab and changed the profile picture in the top right.

- After clicking the three bar panel. I madesure to change the picture for both the logo and the profile picture however I haven't made changes to the typo I've made in the Home tab. My profile also shows the name of "Tom Cook" and his email, which was from the default template given in the tailwind website.

And finally this is my contact page where I provide my contact information like my Instagram page, GitHub page, or perhaps in the future the rest of my social media links to be able to get in touch with me easily.

This is all the pages made from the Laravel project which I have followed from the material given in the classroom. The template used was from Tailwind called the "Stacked Layout" which was a free template for us to tinker with. I've made some changes to the template like changing the previously stock profile picture on the top right, to my own personal picture to give a sense of belonging. I've also made changes to the default logo found in the top left, to my own personal logo. Added a few pictures in my webpages to make it enjoyable for the examiner to grade :D (they're taken by me and I'm proud of the picture taken found in the blog page)









## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
